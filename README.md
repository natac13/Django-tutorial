#Django Tutorial Project

At this stage of my knowledge I know the python language but not how it is 
used in the everyday world. I decided to give modules and projects a look over
and came to Django framework. I have heard the name a lot in my self directed
learning so I am giving it a shot. I think it is right on par with my current 
skill level and if not I have found 2 other tutorials about your first Django
app to follow.
