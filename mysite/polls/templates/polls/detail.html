<!-- A Not on how the method of question choice_set comes into play
- This occurs in the polls/model.py file where I declare the classes themselves
Since I made a class called Choice and gave it a foreign key which I assigned
Question to it. Therefore each Choice has a question field in the model. Now
the part that is a bit confusing is that Django's ORM follow this backwards and
therefore Question ALSO has a field call choice_set where the choice is the name
of the call.

{% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
    <li>{{ choice.choice_text }}</li>
{% endfor %}
