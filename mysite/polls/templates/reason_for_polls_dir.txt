Now we might be able to get away with putting out templates directly in the
polls/templates (rather than creating another polls subdirectory), but it
would actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the first template it finds
whose name matches, and if you had a template with the same name in a different
application, Django would be unable to distinguish between them. We need to be
able to point Django at the right one, and the easiest way to ensure this is by
namespacing them. That is, by putting those template inside another directory
named for the application itself.

Because of how app_directories is set up... with the true setting and looking in
the apps for a templates directory. I can therefore refer to the templates by
polls/index.html instead of polls/templates/polls/index.html like it really is.
